# FreezeGUI

### This is a 1.16.5 based plugin made for moderation in these newer builds.
I originally started this plugin to learn Java further and because I couldn't find any freeze plug-ins that suited my needs.
<br> This is because for me a proper **moderation** freeze plugin needs a window to pop up to prevent resource pack changing, client destruction etc;
